	<h1>Nutrition</h1>
	<main>
		<h2>Welcome to our Nutrition page!</h2>
		<p>At our fitness website, we understand that a healthy and balanced diet is a crucial component of a successful fitness journey. Proper nutrition not only fuels your workouts and helps you achieve your fitness goals, but it also supports overall health and well-being.</p>
		<h3>Here are some tips and information on how to optimize your nutrition for your fitness goals:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Eat a Balanced Diet: A balanced diet consists of a variety of nutrient-dense foods, including lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Strive to eat a variety of colors and types of foods to ensure you are getting all the necessary vitamins and minerals.</li>
			<li>Hydrate Properly: Proper hydration is essential for optimal physical performance. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day and more if you are active or in hot weather.</li>
			<li>Plan Your Meals: Planning your meals in advance can help you stay on track with your nutrition goals. Meal prepping can also save you time and money while ensuring you have healthy options readily available.</li>
			<li>Understand Your Macros: Macronutrients, or "macros," are the three main types of nutrients that provide energy: protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Understanding your individual needs for each macro can help you tailor your diet to meet your specific goals.</li>
			<li>Supplements: While supplements are not necessary for everyone, they can help support certain fitness goals and provide additional nutrients that may be lacking in your diet. However, it's important to do your research and talk to a healthcare professional before taking any supplements.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Remember, nutrition is just as important as exercise when it comes to achieving your fitness goals. Make sure you are fueling your body with the proper nutrients and staying hydrated to support your workouts and overall health.</p>
